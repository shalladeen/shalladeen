# Hi there, I'm Shawna! 

👋 I’m a second-year Software Engineering student passionate about building dynamic user interfaces and rich web experiences using React. I love the creativity involved in frontend development and am equally fascinated by the power of backend technologies, aiming to become a proficient full-stack developer. 🚀

🌐 While I enjoy crafting responsive React projects and delving into databases, I'm also keen on exploring new technologies and pushing the boundaries of what I can create. Whether it's tinkering with Arduino or integrating APIs, I'm all about adding functionality and flair to my applications.

🎮 When I'm not coding, you can find me gaming, reading, or at the gym. I'm always on the lookout for new challenges and ways to enhance my skills.
