# Hi there, I'm Shawna! 

I'm a first-year software engineering student with a passion for creating apps, web apps, and working with databases. I thrive on learning and exploring the vast world of software development, constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to expand my skills.

ðŸŒ± Outside of coding, I'm either gaming, reading, or at the gym
