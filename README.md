# Hi there, I'm Shawna! 

I’m a Software Engineering student focused on frontend development, especially React. I enjoy building clean, responsive interfaces and understanding how everything connects behind the scenes.

Lately, I’ve been working on strengthening my backend skills and learning how to design full-stack systems properly. I’m interested in building applications that are both well-structured and practical.

Outside of coding, I’m usually at the gym, gaming, or reading. I like working on projects that push me to learn something new.
